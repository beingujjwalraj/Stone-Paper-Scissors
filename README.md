# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## HTML Structure (`index.html`)

The HTML file sets up the layout with a title, three clickable choices (rock, paper, scissors), a scoreboard for user and computer scores, and a message container for results.

## CSS Styling (`style.css`)

The CSS file styles the game elements, centering content, styling choices as circular buttons, and enhancing scoreboard visibility.

## JavaScript Logic (`script.js`)

The JavaScript file implements game mechanics, including score tracking, generating random computer choices, and determining outcomes based on user selections. Key functions handle draws and display win/loss messages.

## Conclusion

This game allows users to play against the computer, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts like event handling and DOM manipulation.
